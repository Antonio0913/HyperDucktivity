# HyperDucktivity

HyperDucktivity: a duck-themed todo list with modern features

Users create, edit, and delete tasks and the categories that hold them for a streamlined organizational tool. All data is stored in the cloud, and accounts are secured with login and authentication. 

Project additions are checked with CI/CD and a testing process. 

Group Members: Antonio Chen, Brandon Wong, Justin Koida, Quinn Potter
